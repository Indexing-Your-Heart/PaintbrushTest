#  :art: Paintbrush Test

This source code repo contains a SpriteKit demo that takes player
input with the mouse or touchpad and predicts a number from the
drawn line.

## Purpose

The upcoming _Indexing Your Heart_ game may include a puzzle system
that requires the player to draw a line to solve the puzzle, similar
to _Taiji_ and _The Witness_. Ideally, the system for validating a
drawing will use a machine learning model with Core ML.

## Build from source

- Xcode 14 or later
- macOS 12.3 Monterey or later

Clone the repository using `git clone` or `gh repo clone`, then open
the PaintbrushTest.xcodeproj file. Select Product > Run to run the
demo.
